  - 'Welcome, Commander!


    You are at the beginning of a journey to create an
    interstellar civilization. Your task: collect food, metal, energy and space points
    to build spaceships and stations and increase your influence in the universe.
    Not every planet is habitable - choose wisely how you use your resources. Your
    strategy will be crucial.


    As I am still developing this prototype, it is
    at an early stage and you may find that many features are not yet fully functional.
    I am eager to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you encounter
    any problems or have ideas you would like to share with me, please do not hesitate
    to contact me at [itch.io].


    Together we shape the universe.

    Good luck!'
  - '\uf722 Farm produces food.

    \ue2cd Food is needed for inhabitants. One food
    per inhabitant.

    \uF275 Mine produces metal.

    \uF468 Metal is required
    for building construction.

    \uF7BA Reactor generates energy.

    \uF0E7
    Energy is needed for buildings.

    \uF7C0 Spaceport produces Spacepoints.

    \uF7BF
    Spacepoints are needed for space travel (building spaceships).

    \uF0C3 Research
    points enable research. They are generated per 10 inhabitants on a planet or
    in research centers. The menu opens by clicking on the icon at the top right
    of the screen.



    \uF015 Apartments provide living space for inhabitants.

    \uE533
    Population inhabitants are needed for production and building construction. More
    inhabitants per building = more productivity.'
  - '\uF0AC Construction sites allow one building per site. Each unbuilt site generates
    Eco Points.

    \uF201 Productivity increases resource production and construction
    speed.

    \uF06C Ecological status is important for the population and affects
    productivity.



    \uf49e Storage space on planets and spaceships.

    \uf06a
    Transport order is prioritized blocks other orders

    \uF135 Spaceships transport
    resources to other planets.

    \uF2F9 Spaceship returns to the start.

    \uF466
    Spaceship only launches if the full amount of resources can be transported.

    \uF534
    Mission is repeatedly executed.

    \uF2ED Trash can - demolish buildings.'
