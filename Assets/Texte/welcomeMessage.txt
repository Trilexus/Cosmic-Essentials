Welcome, Commander!

You are at the beginning of a journey to create an interstellar civilization. Your task: Collect food, metal, energy and spacepoints to build spaceships and stations and expand your influence in the universe. Not every planet is habitable - choose wisely how you use your resources. Your strategy will be crucial.

As the game is in an early stage of development, we are particularly dependent on your feedback and suggestions for improvement. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any problems or share your ideas on [itch.io].

Together we shape the universe. Good luck, Commander!

Good luck!
