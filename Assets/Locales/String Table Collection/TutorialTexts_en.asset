    m_Localized: Welcome, chosen crisis manager! As your personal advisor and communications
      interface to the Stellar Federation, I am at your side during this crucial
      phase. You have been chosen to save your species from imminent annihilation,
      a task of immeasurable proportions. Our Federation, which has existed since
      the creation of the cosmic phenomenon Sagittarius A*, pursues the noble goal
      of promoting and protecting the growth and development of young civilizations.

    m_Localized: 'According to our laws, it is our primary duty to protect underdeveloped
      species - such as yours - not only from external threats, but also from their
      own self-destructive tendencies. Despite the fact that your civilization does
      not currently add significant value to the Federation, we would like to offer
      you the opportunity of membership in our youth organization, known as ''The
      Insects''. However, this membership is subject to one crucial condition: You
      must ensure your survival. Unfortunately, our advanced calculations and simulations
      show that this is highly unlikely under the current circumstances.'

    m_Localized: 'Your current form of government and economy is a course that will
      inevitably lead to the destruction of your planet. Time is of the essence and
      the challenges are immense. As the newly appointed steward, it is now in your
      hands to turn the tide: you must make much-needed reforms, implement sustainable
      practices and develop a strategy to save your ecosystem. Furthermore, colonizing
      a neighboring star system is a crucial step in demonstrating that your species
      is capable of evolving and thriving beyond planetary boundaries.'

      granted membership in the Federation, but also access to advanced technologies
      and knowledge that can lead your civilization into a new era. However, if you
      fail, the Federation will have no choice but to turn its back on your destiny
      and prepare for the coming inhabitants of your planet.


      Time is short,
      and the future of your world is in your hands. We stand ready to assist you
      in this crucial endeavor. Good luck, crisis manager.'

      help you get started?"
